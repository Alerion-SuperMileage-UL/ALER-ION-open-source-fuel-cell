# Alér-ION open source hydrogen fuel cell
Alérion Supermilage is a student group at Université Laval who focusses on the developpement of high efficiency vehicles for various competitions. Up until 2024, the team always relied on an internal combustion engines. In 2024, they transition toward an electric-driven system with a battery.

In 2025, the project of a self-made hydrogen PEM fuel cell was born. With the spirit of sharing knowledge and helping others develop this technology, all the relevant design files are release as an open-source project.
