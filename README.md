# Alér-ION open source hydrogen fuel cell
Alérion Supermilage is a student group at Université Laval who focusses on the developpement of high efficiency vehicles for various competitions. Up until 2024, the team always relied on an internal combustion engines. In 2024, they transition toward an electric-driven system with a battery.

In 2025, the project of a self-made hydrogen PEM fuel cell was born. With the spirit of sharing knowledge and helping others develop this technology, all the relevant design files are release as an open-source project.

This is a PEM open cathode fuel cell.

DISCLAIMER: At the moment of writing this, the prototype still has reliability issues. This stack is prone to leaking. Alérion Supermileage waives any responsability related to the usage of this fuel cell design. Note that hydrogen is a flammable gas. Use these files at your own risks.

## Proton exchange membrane
The proton exchange membrane used was a [HP9-Pt ePTFE Reinforced, Pt Impregnated PFSA Membrane](https://www.fuelcellstore.com/eptfe-reinforced-pfsa-membrane-9-microns-pt-impregnated?search=78010010) from the [Fuel Cell store](www.fuelcellstore.com).

Note: Being only 9um thick, this membrane was selected aiming for high performances. However, even though it could handle the working pressure (~6 psi) when tested on in a single cell stack, it was shown to be a weak point when scaling up to multiple cells. It seams to be easily punctured or teared, either in the manual assembly process or by the hydrogen pressure. 

Recommandation: For future developpement, it might be wiser to start using a thickness closer to the industry standard of 50 um to obtain a reliable stack, and then go down in thickness to optimise the performances.
